# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Frontend

This is the frontend for my final year project: **Credit Card Fraud Detection System**. Built with **React JS** and styled using **CSS**, this interface allows users to upload a CSV file containing transaction records. The system sends the file to a machine learning-powered backend that analyzes the transactions and predicts whether they are fraudulent or not.

## 🎯 Project Summary

The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning (a Random Forest model to be precise). 

The frontend allows users to:
- Upload a `.csv` file containing transaction data.
- View prediction results that indicate which transactions are likely fraudulent.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React JS
- **Styling**: CSS
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest (trained offline, served via backend API)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (deployed separately, also in my Github repos)
